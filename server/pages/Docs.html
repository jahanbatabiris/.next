It is an exciting new complex where you can connect with other users,make new friends, participate in community events, win contests, exchange NFTs at the marketplace, and many other fun activities.</p><p class="docstext">In Lucretius, the fun never ends. You can participate in auction events, art exhibitions, concerts and even get paid for having fun with Play &amp; Earn. It is a web-based game that stands out because it offers the best of two worlds. It provides an exhilarating gameplay experience and a platform for players who want to acquire and trade NFTs, even if they have no idea what an NFT is.</p><p class="docstext">Lucretius was not created as a game for only blockchain players. It is aimed at a segment of the gaming community which can be quickly onboarded from other mainstream platforms. Our unique angle offers an exciting way to connect a compelling game narrative with the metaverse and underlying blockchain technology.</p><p class="docstext">With these features, the Lucretius complex can attract millions of gamers to the blockchain ecosystem and create multiple income generation streams in the process. The project leverages the XRPL, which facilitates advanced and in-game DeFi features.</p></div><div id="IntroducingLucretius"><p class="docstitle">Introducing Lucretius</p><p id="GameOverview" class="docstitle2">Game Overview</p><p class="docstext">Welcome to the Lucretius complex - a grand complex where you can make friends and work together to organize auctions, exhibitions, contests, and other community events. By interacting with other players and participating in community events, you can earn rewards. Players can then use these rewards in exchange for in-game assets.</p><p class="docstext">The Lucretius complex is an excellent attempt to create a genuinely public application with an exciting plot that would attract a large portion of the gaming community, blockchain enthusiasts, and DeFi nerds. The map of the Lucretius complex was inspired by the XRP logo. The first version of the game will launch on almost 300,000 square feet of space. The complex will spread across two floors and contain 27 shops (27 on the first floor and 3 on the second floor.)</p><p class="docstext">The game features a fluid, intuitive and attractive interface with many features to explore. As a player, you are in complete control, and you determine how much you want to interact with the game’s decentralized features and DeFi. Furthermore, we built the Lucretius project with a narrative that cannot expire; it is continuous and will live forever.</p><p id="BusinessObjectives" class="docstitle2">Business Objectives, Market, And Target Audience</p><p class="docstext">Lucretius is not to be seen as a game for only blockchain players. It does not require any prior knowledge about cryptocurrencies or blockchain technology in general. The main target is the adventurous segment of the gaming community. Our target audience is slightly bigger than the blockchain gaming community and, by extension, has more potential for revenue.</p><p id="Goals" class="docstitle2">Goals</p><p class="docstext">The Lucretius complex is a unique game with an inspiring background story, an exciting plot, fun features and other characteristics. On the basis of these qualities and considering the segment of the gaming industry the game is targeting, we are confident that the Lucretius complex can compete on the global scene and reach one million players within a short period.</p><p class="docstext">The primary reason is because enjoying the game does not require any prior interest, knowledge or experience with these types of games. The plan is to fully develop the potentials of the XRPL blockchain technology while shielding players from all the complexity that comes with it.</p></div><div id="KeyGameFeatures"><p class="docstitle">Key Game Features</p><p class="docstitle2">Key Features</p><p class="docstext">The Lucretius complex is loaded with many features that make it fun, interactive, and easy to navigate. It is divided into three core areas highlighted below:</p><p id="PlayingArea" class="docstitle3">The Playing Area:</p><p class="docstext">You can join other players and play different games like billiards, bowling, and poker. More games will be added in the future versions of the game. Some include a kids&#x27; playground, a rally racetrack, adventure games and an entire golf course outside the complex.</p><p id="CommunicationArea" class="docstitle3">The Communication Area:</p><p class="docstext">The communication area is where you will find the communication, trade, and auction hall. Here, all players can truly interact and connect. You can trade your avatars items or other in-game assets with other players. The gallery also allows creators to launch auctions, presale events and giveaways for their products.</p><p id="Clubbing" class="docstitle3">The Clubbing/Concert/Conference Area:</p><p class="docstext">This multipurpose area can be used for all kinds of social activities. Players can rent this area for various activities, including clubbing, conferences, AMA sessions, etc. Big DJs, record producers, and music artists can rent the space for concerts and sell tickets right there in the complex.</p><p id="MiddleArea" class="docstitle3">The Middle Area:</p><p class="docstext">In the first version of the game, the middle of the complex has 27 shops that players and other users can buy and use to display their products. 24 of these shops are on the first floor while the remaining 3 are on the second floor. These shops are minted as NFTs so there will be 27 tokens for all the shops. The owner of the token owns the shop and has full authority to rent it out or sell or use for its products. Players and other users will be able to see the all details concerning the shops and their owners. There is a details section at the bottom that users can click to see the link to their website and al their social media pages.</p><p class="docstext">NB: 6 of the 27 shops available in the Lucretius have been reserved by the Moon Light Night platform.</p><p id="SecondFloor" class="docstitle3">The Second Floor:</p><p class="docstext">the complex&#x27;s second floor is where the hall is. It is a large hall that will serve as the gallery by default. The walls are covered with exquisite artwork, and everyone can see information about the artist by clicking on them. All MLN verified artists have the right to showcase their artworks here and put the link of their collection in the marketplace. It has limitation for artists that will be announced at launch. The hall will also be used to host exhibition events. The creator will be in charge of running the exhibition.</p><p id="Otherfeatures" class="docstitle2">Other features</p><p class="docstext">Other essential parts of the game include:</p><p id="Avatar" class="docstitle3">Avatar:</p><p class="docstext">Every player will be represented in the game with an avatar. Your avatar is what you will use to interact with other players. You can change your avatar&#x27;s appearance by adding different assets to it. Project creators can order their NFT avatars to add it in the game. The price of order will depend on the time of order.</p><p id="GameAssets" class="docstitle3">In-Game Assets:</p><p class="docstext">items that can be bought within the complex and deployed. Some in- game purchases include avatars, shops, concert tickets, artworks from the gallery/exhibition hall, and so on. These assets are minted as NFTs and players can trade them with each other inside the Lucretius complex. However, some assets (like concert tickets) come with an expiry date and cannot be used outside of the complex.</p><p id="ReputationSystem" class="docstitle3">Reputation System:</p><p class="docstext">The game will also feature a reputation system that rewards active players with exclusive benefits based on their level of participation/activity. For example, we implement a three-tier reputation system where players can upgrade their status by being active in the complex and interacting with other players.</p><p id="CommunityEvents" class="docstitle3">Shared Quests And Community Events:</p><p class="docstext">The primary purpose of the Lucretius complex is to create an atmosphere that will develop a sense of community among all players. The complex will make it possible for players to come together and organize community events.</p><p id="ComingSoon" class="docstitle2">Coming Soon</p><p class="docstext">Other exciting features coming in future versions of the game include:</p><p id="CrossChainMarketplace" class="docstitle3">In-Game Cross-Chain Marketplace:</p><p class="docstext">The NFT marketplace will play a chief part of the Lucretius experience. The marketplace will be based on the XRPL ledger and will grant players immutable ownership of the assets they purchase in it. We expect it to be a central hub of activity where players flock to as a part of their Lucretius experience. Players can sell their NFTs across different blockchain networks like XRPL, Ethereum, and Solana.</p><p id="MoreGamesAdded" class="docstitle3">More Games Added To The Complex:</p><p class="docstext">Many more games will be added to the complex to add variety to its offering. Games like rally racing, golf and other adventure/mystery games will be added. As such, we will build an entire golf course, a rally racetrack, and a kids&#x27; playground outside the complex. In the same vein, the town around the complex will develop with more shops around each game.</p></div><div id="BlockchainFeatures"><p class="docstitle">Blockchain Features</p><p id="GameCurrency" class="docstitle2">Game Currency, The LUC Token</p><p class="docstext">The native currency of the game is the LUC token. It is mirrored as a cryptocurrency that operates on the XRPL network. It allows you to play, invest, and become a part of the complex. The total supply of LUC tokens is 1,000,000,000 and below are some of its uses:</p><ul style="list-style-type:circle" class="docstext"><li>It can be used as a medium of exchange between players.</li><li>NFTs and other digital assets can be purchased from the complex using LUC tokens.</li><li>LUC staking can offer a reward to players.</li><li>The complex can reward active users with LUC tokens for completing tasks and winning competitions.</li></ul><p id="XLS-20/XRPL" class="docstitle2">XLS-20/XRPL Compatibility</p><p class="docstext">Ethereum was the first blockchain network to support NFTs functionalities. i.e., on Ethereum, you can easily mint, trade, and even burn NFTs. The shortcoming of the Ethereum network is that it can easily get congested during times of high traffic. This congestion leads to very sluggish transaction speeds and very high transaction fees. XRPL, on the other hand, is an ultra-efficient blockchain-based payment processing platform that guarantees lightning-fast transactions (three to five seconds) and low transaction fees. In other words, it is a decentralized public blockchain that is extremely fast, reliable, and requires minimal energy.</p><p class="docstext">The inherent advantages (speed and cost) of the XRPL make it a perfect alternative to the Ethereum network as a platform for minting, trading, and burning NFTs. The XRPL can process thousands of transactions simultaneously without getting congested like the Ethereum blockchain network.</p><p class="docstext">The NFT industry is expanding rapidly, and its growth is coming to the XRPL network. In Sept 2021, XRPL’s parent company, Ripple Labs, released a $250 million fund for developers, content creators, artists, and brands to develop and implement new use cases for the XRPL.</p><p class="docstext">More recently, on January 12, 2022, RippleX released the XLS-20-based NFT-Devnet for users to test XRPL&#x27;s blockchain&#x27;s capacity for NFTs. Now, developers and other members of the XRPL community can mint NFTs for the first time on the blockchain.</p><p class="docstext">The Lucretius complex is XLS-20 compatible. In other words, Lucretius will implement the full capabilities and functionalities of NFTs on the XRPL.</p><p class="docstitle3">Game Assets</p><p id="Collectiblesandscarcity" class="docstitle3">Collectibles And Scarcity</p><p class="docstext">Scarcity and collectible items are fundamental in games, and the Lucretius complex is no different. It contains several limited-edition items, scarce NFTs, and so on. It will also include lots of user-generated content.</p><p class="docstext">The complex is very transparent and will display every relevant piece of information, for example, how many units of an asset exist in the ecosystem. The game adopts a decentralized structure which helps to improve the overall experience.</p><p id="FullyDecentralizedAssets" class="docstitle3">Fully Decentralized Assets</p><p class="docstext">Most blockchain-based games deploy NFTs as small amounts of binary data that signifies ownership of an asset. In Lucretius, NFTs will have more functionalities and characteristics. You will enjoy complete control of each NFT and how it looks, its non- physical qualities (like speed, strength, etc.), and the game logic of implementing the asset.</p><p class="docstext">In most blockchain games, this information is often stored elsewhere, not under the player&#x27;s control and instead under the complete control of the game company. At Lucretius, we strive to improve on this as much as possible. Lucretius stores much more data about items on-chain. Also, the logic of things will be defined in a free/libre/open- source game, running on-chain.</p><p id="MarketplacesAndTrading" class="docstitle2">Marketplaces And Trading</p><p class="docstext">A consequence of the decentralized ownership of assets in the complex is that you can seamlessly trade your holdings across different marketplaces. This feature will incentivize players to acquire more in-game purchases. You can sell these items in several marketplaces.</p><p class="docstitle2">An Ever-Expanding World</p><p id="NFTCreator" class="docstitle3">NFT Creator</p><p class="docstext">The Lucretius NFT Creator is a unique feature that allows players to build their in-game assets based on specific constraints defined by an outline. Depending on the uniqueness of the design, a lot of materials may be required to create an NFT.</p><p class="docstext">The bigger the outline, the more materials will be used to craft the NFT. Lucretius reserves the right to impose constraining rules and review steps for NFT creation to prevent abuse. The NFT creator will be gradually rolled out to users, either through competitions or by selling the feature for LUC tokens.</p><p id="GameCreator" class="docstitle3">Game Creator</p><p class="docstext">The Lucretius game creator allows users to create their mini-games, quests, contests, and so much more. Some of its key features are highlighted below:</p><p id="Terrain" class="docstitle4">Terrain:</p><p class="docstext">Players will be able to create their obstacle course. The process is so simple that all the player has to do to position items in a terrain. Players will develop their mazes obstacle courses by building and using terrain features. The game&#x27;s first version will organize community-created events like mazes, racetracks, dancehalls, parties, etc. You can develop lotteries and competitions that require in-game assets to take part in. There are endless opportunities for monetization; you can even organize concerts and sell tickets just as you would in real life.</p><p id="ProgrammerInterfaceAndScripting" class="docstitle4">Programmer Interface Ind Scripting:</p><p class="docstext">We are exploring to make the game extensible by exposing an API to developers and integrating a scripting language. This could open up creative possibilities for players within Lucretius and developers.</p><p id="GameCore" class="docstitle2">Game Core</p><p class="docstext">Backend: XRPL</p><p class="docstext">The first layer to the Lucretius project is the backend infrastructure for the game. Every part of the ecosystem was developed to run on the XRPL. In other words, the ecosystem will leverage XRPL to operate user accounts, token transfers, relational data, player progress etc.</p><p class="docstext">As such, the game will inherit the ultra-fast speeds of the network and deliver a seamless immersive experience for players. The unique qualities of the XRPL provides Lucretius with ability to do complex backend logic on the blockchain at lightning-fast speeds. As such, players will enjoy an immersive, responsive and seamless gameplay experience every time.</p><p class="docstext">Frontend: Unity</p><p class="docstext">The client area is the second layer to the Lucretius complex and it is developed in unity. The primary concerns for this layer revolve around aspects such as gameplay loops and daily activities that will promote player retention in the long run.</p><p class="docstext">To this effect, this layer is designed to be fun for all types of players and up to par with the most rated games. It is also the layer that connects the backend with the frontend, login-registration edge cases as well as stability and stability for multiplayer features.</p><p id="GameEconomy" class="docstitle2">Game Economy</p><p class="docstext">The third area of the Lucretius complex is the economic infrastructure. It covers aspects of the game such as NFT trading, shop selling and renting, and LUC token transactions.</p><p class="docstext">Backend: XRPL</p><p class="docstext">The entire Lucretius complex experience (the gaming, the NFT marketplace and auction logic) is done on the XRPL.</p><p class="docstext">Frontend: Web and Unity</p><p class="docstext">The frontend to marketplaces and auctions can be accessed as a web application embedded into the game. Parts of the user experience might also be done directly in Unity.</p><p id="GovernanceDAO" class="docstitle2">Governance DAO</p><p class="docstext">The Lucretius project will not create only a game but also the structure for a fully- fledged Decentralized Autonomous Organization called the Lucretius council.</p><p class="docstext">Backend: XRPL</p><p class="docstext">Voting and rules of governance in the Lucretius council can easily be implemented in XRPL. The network is capable of handling all governance related tasks swiftly.</p><p class="docstext">Frontend: Web</p><p class="docstext">The DAO interface will be a web application, outside of the Lucretius complex.</p></div><div id="IntroducingLucretius"><p class="docstitle">Tokenomics</p><p id="TokenInformation" class="docstitle2">Token Information</p><p class="docstext">The Lucretius token LUC is the native currency of the Lucretius ecosystem.
